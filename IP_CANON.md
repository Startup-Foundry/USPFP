- Prevent implied licenses or downstream misuse

This document is **authoritative canon**.

---

**Jonathan Mitchell Anderson**
and/or his controlled entities, including without limitation:

(collectively, the **"IP Owner"**).

---

## 4. Scope of Protection & Trade Secret Designation
This declaration applies to **all present and future Works**, whether fixed, executable, conceptual, or derived, including but not limited to:

- Source code, binaries, and infrastructure definitions
- Schemas, migrations, APIs, data models, and database structures
- Documentation, specifications, READMEs, and canon files
- Agent instructions, prompts, initialization contracts, and orchestration logic
- CI/CD workflows, automation logic, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems
- UI/UX copy, design systems, product language, and interaction flows
- Generated outputs produced by AI Systems under the control of the IP Owner
- Architectural patterns, system designs, workflows, methodologies, and operational know-how

**Trade Secret Notice:**
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Works include and embody **confidential and proprietary trade secrets**, including non-public technical information, business logic, system architecture, processes, methodologies, data structures, and strategic know-how.

The existence of Works within a version-controlled repository, deployment environment, or execution context — including private, shared, or limited-access systems — **does not constitute public disclosure** and does not waive trade secret protection.

All such Works are **proprietary, confidential, and protected as trade secrets**, unless and only to the extent explicitly designated otherwise in a written instrument signed by the IP Owner.

---

## 5. Authorship, Work-for-Hire & Moral Rights Waiver
All Contributions are deemed to be:
- **Works-for-hire**, and where not legally classified as such,
- **Irrevocably assigned** to the IP Owner

To the maximum extent permitted by law, all contributors (human or artificial) **waive any and all moral rights**, including but not limited to:
- Rights of attribution
- Rights of integrity
- Rights of withdrawal or modification objection

Where waiver is not permitted, contributors agree **not to assert** such rights.

---

## 6. AI-Assisted Creation & Control
All AI-assisted outputs are generated:
- At the direction of the IP Owner
- Under the IP Owner's exclusive control
- For the sole benefit of the IP Owner

No AI System, platform provider, or intermediary acquires:
- Ownership
- Authorship
- License
- Training rights
- Derivative rights

---

## 7. Prohibited Uses (Explicit & Non-Exhaustive)
Absent express written permission, the following are **strictly prohibited**:
- Copying, redistribution, or mirroring
- Creation of derivative works
- Commercial exploitation
- Re-hosting or resale
- Use as training data for AI or ML models
- Fine-tuning, embedding, indexing, or vectorization
- Prompt extraction or reverse engineering
- Use in competing or substitute products

---

## 8. Trade Secret Preservation & Confidentiality Survival
Certain Works constitute **confidential and proprietary trade secrets**, even if stored in a version-controlled repository, deployment environment, or execution context.

Disclosure for development, review, testing, deployment, or execution purposes **does not** waive trade secret protection.

All reasonable measures are taken to maintain secrecy and control.

**Survival of Confidentiality Obligations:**
All obligations relating to confidentiality, non-disclosure, and protection of trade secrets **survive indefinitely**, including after termination of access, contribution, employment, contract, license, or any other relationship, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

---

## 9. No Implied License
No license or right is granted by:
- Access
- Visibility
- Contribution
- Execution
- AI interaction

All rights are reserved unless expressly granted in writing.

---

## 10. Public Repositories, Private License & Market Deployment
All Works are distributed, if at all, under a **private, proprietary license**.

If this repository is publicly accessible:
- Visibility does **not** imply permission
- No open-source license is granted
- No public or community license is implied

Publication for live, commercial, or production purposes — including deployment to servers, platforms, or marketplaces — does not waive any rights and does not convert the Works into open or public-domain material.

Any included license applies **only to the specific scope explicitly stated** and is subordinate to this canon.

This canon controls in case of conflict.

## 11. Governing Law, Venue & Cross-Border Enforcement (Tiered)
This declaration is governed by, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, to the maximum extent permitted by law:

### Tier 1 – Core Global Anchors
- **Canada**, including both civil-law and common-law traditions (including Québec and Ontario);
- **The United States of America**, including applicable federal law and the laws of the States of New York and Delaware;
- **England and Wales**.

### Tier 2 – Global Brand & Enforcement Credibility

All of the foregoing are applied without regard to conflict-of-law principles, and shall be construed cumulatively, not alternatively.

Exclusive venue lies, at the IP Owner's sole election, in courts of competent jurisdiction in any of the foregoing jurisdictions, and the IP Owner reserves the right to pursue concurrent or successive enforcement actions where permitted by law.

---

## 12. Enforcement, Survival & Severability
All provisions:
- Survive termination of access
- Bind successors and assigns
- Remain enforceable even if one provision is held invalid

Unauthorized use may result in injunctive relief, damages, and equitable remedies.

---

## 13. Canon Supremacy, Construction & No Waiver
This document supersedes all informal, oral, or inconsistent statements.

It shall be interpreted broadly in favor of the IP Owner's rights and narrowly against any finding of implied license, consent, waiver, estoppel, or acquiescence.

Silence, delay, partial enforcement, selective enforcement, or failure to object shall not constitute consent, waiver, estoppel, or limitation of rights.

Any modification requires explicit written authorization by the IP Owner, clear attribution, and traceable commit history. Unauthorized modification constitutes a material violation.

---

## 14. Binding Notice & Future Jurisdiction Inclusion
By accessing, executing, deploying, or contributing to this repository, you acknowledge:

> "All Works herein are proprietary canon works, owned exclusively by the IP Owner, with no implied, transferable, or future-granted rights."

In addition to the jurisdictions expressly listed, **any jurisdiction materially connected to the development, hosting, deployment, commercialization, distribution, or enforcement of the Works shall be deemed included**, to the maximum extent permitted by law. This inclusion is automatic and does not require amendment of this document.
